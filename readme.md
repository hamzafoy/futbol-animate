## What is this?

While designing a website for a client running a nonprofit specializing in sports philanthropy, I found myself becoming more interested in incredible `SVG` animations. I initially designed this with HTML5, CSS3, but decided to publish a neat little `React` code-block for anyone's use. If you deem it useful to you, thanks for the download!

1. Run `npm install futbol-animate`
2. Import using `import { AnimatedCookingPot } from 'biryani-animate'`
3. Enjoy a *starting state* of a rolling soccer ball with color & a `:hover` animation of said ball bouncing up and down.
