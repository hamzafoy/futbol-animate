## What is this?

While designing a website for a client running a nonprofit specializing in sports philanthropy, I found myself becoming more interested in incredible `SVG` animations. I initially designed this with HTML5, CSS3, but decided to publish a neat little `React` code-block for anyone's use. If you deem it useful to you, thanks for the download!

1. DO NOT RUN, THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP)
